Welcome to my personal website!

I am an incoming first year PhD student from [College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing), [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/). I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Daniel Paulin](https://sites.google.com/site/paulindani/home?authuser=0). Prior to that, I received my Master's degree in Mathematical Sciences at [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) in 2024. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics at [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/) in 2023.

Currently, I am very interested in theory, algorithms and applications around generative modelling. I am also broadly interested in other topics of statistics and machine learning.

You can contact me at YAOZ0012@e.ntu.edu.sg.
